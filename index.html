<p>I decided I wanted to build a project to help me learn Three.js.  The app is a basic three dimensional maze.  The user is represented by a first-person camera.</p>

<p>Three.js is a great library.  It simplifies a lot of things about making 3d scenes.  The most challenging aspect of this project was building up the maze.  I actually had to build in a second overhead camera in order to see if I was rendering the walls correctly.  When I started the project, I didn't realize I would need to write code that allowed me to examine if my other code was working.</p>

<p>The other big challenge was collision detection.  Once I had everything rendered to the screen, I quickly realized the walls had no physical properties.  Basically, the user was in "god mode" and could run through any walls.  In order to fix this, I had to test for when objects were occupying the same space and not allow the camera to pass through.</p>
